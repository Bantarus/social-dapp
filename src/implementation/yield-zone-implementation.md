  - Auto-renewal option
- Payment in native tokens
  - Direct blockchain transactions
  - Smart contract managed
  - Yield distribution to active users

### 3. Content Types
- Project Announcements

### 4. Yield Distribution
- 70% to active platform users based on:
  - Influence score
  - Daily activity
  - Achievement level
- 20% to platform development
- 10% to content curators

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface YieldSlot {
  id: string;
  advertiser: {
    address: string;
    name: string;
    verified: boolean;
  };
  content: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    media?: string;
    callToAction: {
      text: string;
      url: string;
    };
  };
  metrics: {
    bidAmount: number;
    startTime: string;
    duration: number;
    impressions: number;
    engagement: number;
  };
  distribution: {
    userPool: number;
    platformPool: number;
    curatorPool: number;
  };
}

interface UserYieldMetrics {
  totalEarned: number;
  lastClaim: string;
  multiplier: number; // based on influence & achievements
  claimableAmount: number;
}
```

### Smart Contract Features
```solidity
contract YieldManager {
    // Slot management
    function bidForSlot(uint256 duration) external payable;
    function renewSlot(uint256 slotId) external payable;
    
    // Yield distribution
    function claimYield() external;
    function calculateUserShare(address user) external view returns (uint256);
    
    // Analytics
    function getActiveSlots() external view returns (Slot[] memory);
    function getSlotMetrics(uint256 slotId) external view returns (Metrics memory);
}
```

## User Interface Integration

### 1. Yield Zone Display
```typescript
interface YieldZoneProps {
  activeSlots: YieldSlot[];
  userMetrics: UserYieldMetrics;
  onSlotClick: (slot: YieldSlot) => void;
}

// Component Features
- Carousel/slider for multiple slots
- Engagement tracking
- Click-through analytics
- Yield earning indicators
```

### 2. Advertiser Dashboard
- Slot bidding interface
- Performance metrics
- Content management
- Budget tracking

### 3. User Yield Interface
- Earnings overview
- Claim mechanism
- Activity multipliers
- Historical data

## Economics & Incentives

### 1. Pricing Model
- Base price: X tokens per 4h slot
- Premium periods (high activity times)
- Competitive bidding mechanics
- Long-term booking discounts

### 2. User Benefits
- Passive earning opportunity
- Activity incentivization
- Community participation rewards
- Influence score boosts

### 3. Platform Sustainability
- Revenue stream for development
- Community reward mechanism
- Content quality improvement
- Engagement driver

4. Maintain platform quality through curation

Would you like me to:
1. Detail any specific aspect of the yield system?
2. Elaborate on the economic model?
3. Provide more specific UI mockups?
4. Expand on the smart contract implementation?
