# DecentraPost - Enhanced Engagement Specifications

## 1. Gamification Elements

### Energy System
- Users have a daily "Energy" quota (100 points)
- Actions cost different amounts of energy:
  - Regular post: 5 energy
  - Repost: 2 energy
  - Comment: 3 energy
  - Like: 1 energy
- Energy regenerates 4 points per hour
- Premium/active users can increase their max energy capacity

### Achievement Chains
- Instead of traditional badges, implement "Achievement Chains"
- Each action builds upon previous ones to create unique combinations
- Example chains:
  ```
  Post → Get 5 likes → Get 3 comments = "Conversation Starter" chain
  3 days active → Help 5 users → Get verified = "Community Builder" chain
  ```

### Influence Score
- Dynamic score (0-100) affected by:
  - Post quality (engagement ratio)
  - Community helpfulness
  - Streak maintenance
  - Chain completions
- Displayed as a glowing aura around user avatar
- Changes color based on score ranges
- Provides temporary boosts to energy regeneration

### Weekly Challenges
- Time-limited tasks that reward unique "Chain Links"
- Examples:
  - "Start 3 meaningful discussions"
  - "Connect with 5 new users in your field"
  - "Share knowledge about blockchain technology"
- Rewards focus on platform capabilities rather than cosmetic items

## 2. Lightweight Engagement System

### Smart Comments
- Comments are collapsed by default
- Show only the most relevant comments based on:
  - Commenter's influence score
  - Comment engagement
  - Content relevance
- Implement "Quick Reactions" instead of full comments
  - Predefined short responses
  - Emoji reactions with context
  - Voice snippets (max 5 seconds)

### Intelligent Reposts
- "Echo" system instead of traditional reposts
  - Echoes maintain a reference to original content
  - Each echo can add only one new insight (280 chars)
  - Original post's engagement is shared with echo chain
- Echo Chain Visualization:
  - Shows how ideas evolve
  - Highlights different perspectives
  - Limits echo depth to 3 levels to prevent noise

### Content Discovery

#### Speed Zones
- Content is organized in "Speed Zones":
  - Fast Lane: Quick updates, hot topics (24h lifetime)
  - Cruise Lane: Meaningful discussions (72h lifetime)
  - Archive Lane: Knowledge base (permanent, highly curated)

#### Smart Feed
- Feed automatically adjusts content density based on:
  - User's available energy
  - Reading speed and patterns
  - Time of day
  - Previous engagement patterns

## 3. Performance Considerations

### Client-Side Optimization
- Implement virtual scrolling
- Lazy load comments and echo chains
- Cache frequently accessed content
- Progressive loading of user achievements

### Blockchain Integration
- Batch transactions for energy system
- Store only hash references on-chain
- Cache commonly accessed data in local state
- Use optimistic updates for better UX

## 4. Future Expansion Possibilities

### Community Features
- Temporary "Energy Pools" for group projects
- Cross-chain achievement verification
- Collaborative chain building
- Community-driven challenge creation

### Advanced Gamification
- Seasonal themes for achievements
- Special event chains
- Knowledge-sharing multipliers
- Reputation-based governance participation

## 5. Anti-Gaming Measures

### Protection Mechanisms
- Energy cost increases for rapid repetitive actions
- Achievement chains require varied actions
- Influence score includes velocity checks
- Natural cool-down periods for high-impact actions

### Quality Control
- Automated content quality scoring
- Community-based curation incentives
- Progressive trust system
- Rate limiting based on account age and status
