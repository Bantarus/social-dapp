# DecentraPost - Decentralized Social Platform Specification

## Project Overview
A decentralized social platform that reimagines content sharing through an innovative Speed Zone system, focusing on content relevance timing rather than traditional chronological feeds, built on the Archethic blockchain for true decentralization.

## Core Concept
- Replace traditional timeline-based social media with dynamic Speed Zones
- Enable organic content lifecycle management
- Ensure engagement quality through an energy system
- Focus on meaningful interactions rather than viral mechanics
- Implement gamification for sustainable engagement

## Key Features

### 1. Speed Zone System
- Three distinct content zones:
  - Fast Lane (24h)
    - Breaking news
    - Hot topics
    - Time-sensitive content
  - Cruise Lane (72h)
    - Discussions
    - Analysis
    - Community debates
  - Archive Lane (Permanent)
    - Knowledge base
    - Guides
    - Valuable resources

### 2. Energy Mechanism
- Daily energy quota system
  - 100 points base allocation
  - 4 points per hour regeneration
  - Action costs:
    - Post: 5 energy
    - Echo: 2 energy
    - Comment: 3 energy
    - Like: 1 energy

### 3. Dashboard Features
- Content management
  - Zone-based filtering
  - Engagement metrics
  - Content type filtering
  - Velocity tracking
- Profile system
  - Achievement chains
  - Influence score
  - Energy management
- Echo system visualization

### 4. User Interface Requirements
- Modern, clean design
- Zone-specific layouts
- Energy visualization
- Achievement display
- Transaction history
- Real-time updates

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
1. Zone Dashboard
   - Dynamic content grid
   - Zone navigation
   - Filtering system
   - Energy meter

2. Post Components
   - Content display
   - Engagement metrics
   - Zone indicators
   - Echo chains

3. Interactive Elements

### Data Structures
```typescript
Post {
  id: string
  content: string
  author: {
    address: string
    username: string
    influence: number
  }
  timestamp: string
  zone: 'fast' | 'cruise' | 'archive'
  engagement: {
    likes: number
    echoes: number
    comments: number
  }
  metadata: {
    type: 'text' | 'thread' | 'echo' | 'guide'
    originTxHash?: string
    chainPosition?: number
    tags: string[]
  }
  metrics: {
    engagementVelocity: number
    qualityScore: number
  }
}

User {
  address: string
  username: string
  profile: {
    bio: string
    avatar: string
    joinedDate: string
  }
  metrics: {
    influence: number
    energy: {
      current: number
      max: number
      lastRegeneration: string
    }
    achievements: Achievement[]
  }
}
```
